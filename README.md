# Nya NN

It's my study project so It's not supposed to be deployed any

Welcome to my hardcoded neural network framework. You may have the question on your mind
"Why did you do that? There are lots of frameworks for building neural networks out there!".
So the answer is IT'S STUDY PROJECT. I learn by writing code for the project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

It's hardcoded so it doesn't have any external dependencies.

### Installing

To get a copy of the library run:

```bash
make package
```

It will create the file [nyann.tar.gz](build/nyann.tar.gz). Unpack the archive
wherever you want. And use header `nyann.h` to use all the facilities of the library.

## Running the tests

To run the tests go to `nya-nn/nyann` folder and run the following commands:

```bash
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
./runTests
```

## Deployment

This is study project so it's not supposed to by deployed anywhere.
